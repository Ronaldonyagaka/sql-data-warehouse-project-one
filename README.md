# 📦 SQL Server Data Warehouse (ETL Pipeline Project)

This project implements a full **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline for building a scalable **data warehouse** using **SQL Server**. It involves ingesting raw data from multiple source systems, cleaning and transforming the data across multiple layers (Bronze → Silver → Gold), and preparing it for downstream analytics and reporting.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a robust, maintainable data warehouse on SQL Server. The architecture uses a **layered approach** to data processing and storage:

* **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion
* **Silver Layer**: Cleaned and transformed data
* **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data models (facts & dimensions)

This setup supports analytical reporting and business intelligence use cases.

---

## 🛠️ ETL Architecture

* **Extraction**: Data is pulled from source systems (e.g., CRM, ERP)
* **Transformation**: Data cleaning, deduplication, standardization, and relationship modeling
* **Loading**: Data is incrementally loaded into the data warehouse following the layered model

---

## 🧱 Layered Data Model

### 🥉 Bronze Layer

* Raw data ingested directly from source systems.
* Table names follow:

  ```
  <source_system>_<original_table_name>
  ```
* Example: `crm_customer_info`

### 🥈 Silver Layer

* Cleaned and standardized version of Bronze data.
* Naming remains the same as Bronze:

  ```
  <source_system>_<original_table_name>
  ```

### 🥇 Gold Layer

* Final business model used for analytics and reporting.
* Naming convention:

  ```
  <category>_<entity>
  ```
* Examples:

  * `dim_customers`
  * `fact_sales`

---

## 🧾 Naming Conventions

### General Principles

* Use `snake_case`
* Use **English** for all names
* Avoid SQL **reserved words**

---

### Table Naming

#### Bronze & Silver Layers

```
<source_system>_<entity>
```

* `crm_customer_info`
* `erp_order_header`

#### Gold Layer

```
<category>_<entity>
```

* `dim_customers`
* `fact_sales`
* `report_sales_monthly`

---

### Column Naming

#### Surrogate Keys

```
<table_name>_key
```

* `customer_key`, `product_key`

#### Technical Columns

```
dwh_<column_name>
```

* `dwh_load_date`: Date record was loaded
* `dwh_created_by`: Source system or user

---

### Stored Procedures

Naming convention:

```
load_<layer>
```

Examples:

* `load_bronze`
* `load_silver`
* `load_gold`

These are responsible for orchestrating the data loads between ETL layers.

## 📘 Glossary of Patterns

| Pattern   | Meaning         | Example(s)                    |
| --------- | --------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `dim_`    | Dimension table | `dim_product`, `dim_customer` |
| `fact_`   | Fact table      | `fact_sales`, `fact_orders`   |
| `report_` | Report table    | `report_sales_monthly`        |
| `dwh_`    | System metadata | `dwh_load_date`, `dwh_status` |
